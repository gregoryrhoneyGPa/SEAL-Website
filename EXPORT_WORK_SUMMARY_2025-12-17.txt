SEAL Site — Consolidated Export
Date: 2025-12-17

Purpose
- Single-file reference of all work performed in the `V1` workspace to review later.

High-level summary
- Parsed live site and merged authoritative SEO/JSON-LD into `Index.html` (backup at `Index.original.html`).
- Built component library (`components.html` + `css/components.css`) and started replacing header/footer/hero across pages (backups created as `.original.html`).
- Downloaded many Wix/Gamma CDN images into `images/` and created a Canva originals folder at `images/canva/originals/`.
- Created `scripts/webopt_canva.py` to produce JPEG + WebP optimized outputs from Canva originals; script exists but was not completed due to a cancelled run.
- Created pickled scaffold page `scaffold-pages/pickleball-passport.html` with responsive <picture> markup and Calendly CTA.

Files created or modified (not exhaustive, key items)
- Index.merged.html (merge candidate)
- Index.original.html (backup)
- Index.html (merged authoritative SEO + content)
- components.html (component snippets)
- css/components.css (component styles)
- scripts/webopt_canva.py (Pillow-based image optimizer)
- images/ (many live assets downloaded from Wix/Gamma)
- images/canva/originals/ (Canva source files)
- images/canva/alt-texts.csv/alt-texts.csv (CSV with alt text for hero + pickleball images)
- scaffold-pages/pickleball-passport.html (patched with Gamma copy + responsive images)
- about.original.html (backup)
- about.html (patched to include canonical header/footer and link to css/components.css)
- contact.original.html (backup created just now)

Where the export lives
- File path: V1/EXPORT_WORK_SUMMARY_2025-12-17.txt (this file)

How to produce the web-optimized images (if you want to run locally)
- Requirements: Python 3.8+, pip, Pillow.
- From the `V1` folder, run:

PowerShell
```powershell
python -m pip install --user --upgrade pip
python -m pip install --user pillow
# run the optimizer script (adjust path if needed)
python .\scripts\webopt_canva.py
```

Notes & expectations from the script
- Inputs: files under `images/canva/originals/` (script matches by substring to map filenames).
- Outputs: `images/canva/hero-home.jpg`, `hero-home.webp`, `hero-pickleball.jpg`, `hero-pickleball.webp`, `pickleball-1.jpg`/`.webp`, etc.
- Quality: JPEG ~75, WebP created alongside JPEG.
- If any CDN-original assets returned AccessDenied, manually download via browser and place in `images/`.

Next recommended steps
1. Run `scripts/webopt_canva.py` to generate optimized images and verify they appear in `images/canva/`.
2. Continue replacing header/footer/hero on the remaining pages (create `.original.html` backups before each overwrite).
3. Run accessibility and SEO checks (axe / Lighthouse) and address findings.

Contact points and authoritative data included
- The merged `Index.html` contains JSON-LD with Organization/localBusiness contact details (phone +1 (813) 951-6491) and canonical metadata.

If you'd like
- I can (A) run the optimizer now and update pages to point to the generated images, or (B) produce a smaller PDF export of this summary. Tell me which.

End of export.
