Subject: DNS Update Request for sealenterprise.net

Hi,

I need to update the DNS records for sealenterprise.net to point to my new GitHub Pages hosting. Please make the following changes:

REMOVE the existing A record that currently points to 66.223.49.89

ADD these four new A records:

Type: A
Host/Name: @ (or root/apex domain)
Value/Points to: 185.199.108.153
TTL: 3600 (or default)

Type: A
Host/Name: @
Value/Points to: 185.199.109.153
TTL: 3600

Type: A
Host/Name: @
Value/Points to: 185.199.110.153
TTL: 3600

Type: A
Host/Name: @
Value/Points to: 185.199.111.153
TTL: 3600

OPTIONAL - WWW subdomain (recommended):

Type: CNAME
Host/Name: www
Value/Points to: gregoryrhoneygpa.github.io
TTL: 3600

These are the official GitHub Pages IP addresses for custom domain hosting. Please let me know once the changes are complete so I can verify the DNS propagation.

Thank you!
