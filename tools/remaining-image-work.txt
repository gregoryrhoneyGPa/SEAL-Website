Remaining non-optimized `images/canva/` references
===============================================

Files with references to non-`optimized/` image paths (review/next steps):

- scaffold-pages/pickleball-passport.html
  - `../images/canva/pickleball-3.webp`
  - `../images/canva/pickleball-3.jpg`
  - Action: run `scripts/webopt_canva.py` (or your Node-based optimizer) to generate optimized variants for `pickleball-3` (1200x800) into `images/canva/optimized/`.

- scaffold-pages/pickleball-passport.original.html (backup copy)
  - references `hero-pickleball.jpg` and `pickleball-3.jpg` — this is a preserved original; no change required unless you want backups updated.

- V2/instructions/SCRIPTS_README.md and EXPORT_*.txt
  - documentation mentions `images/canva/hero-home.webp` or similar; these are docs only and not urgent.

Recommended commands to generate missing optimized assets (run locally):

1) Using the included Python helper (requires Pillow):

   python scripts/webopt_canva.py

   - This will read `images/canva/originals/` and write `.jpg` and `.webp` outputs into `images/canva/` (names per mapping).

2) Or run the Node image optimizer you used earlier (if you prefer AVIF variants):

   npm run optimize

   - This writes AVIF/WebP/JPG variants into `images/canva/optimized/` and updates `report.json`.

After generating optimized files, re-run the repo-wide replacement step (I can do this) to convert the remaining raw references to responsive `picture` markup pointing at `images/canva/optimized/` and commit changes.

If you want me to proceed now, I will:
 - generate a list of files I will update,
 - create backups for each file edited,
 - replace references only when the optimized asset exists,
 - commit changes incrementally and report results.
